Setting some boxes in a horizontal row with CSS Flexbox is easy.
Showing only one box at a time with overflow and making it swipable with overscroll-behavior is easy.
You can make the “slides” line up nicely with scroll-snap-type.
A couple of #jump-links is all you need to make navigation for it, which you can make all nice and smooth with scroll-behavior.
